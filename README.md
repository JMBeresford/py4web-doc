### py4web documentation with rtd style

Created with sources from the py4web official documentation (https://github.com/web2py/py4web/tree/master/apps/_documentation) in MarkMin format plus regex magic
to obtain standard MarkDown documents. Then I've shrinked them with Pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) to obtain the rst files.

Finally I've followed the excellent work of Michael Altfield on https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/2020/07/18/sphinx-rtd-github-pages-1/ in order to have HTML, PDF and EPUB
automagically published and updated on GitHub pages at https://nicozanf.github.io/py4web-doc
